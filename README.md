## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.


### 2. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install the required Python packages:

```sh
cd image-processing-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required Python packages:

```sh
cd image-processing-frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified in your React configuration).

### Troubleshooting
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Check for any errors in the console output of both the frontend and backend servers and address them accordingly.
